Click Code then click download zip, then just follow the steps.

Open "FrpStub.exe" then go to the Builder's tab, then click all the settings you want
(if you dont know what they do go to the Documentation Tab to see what they do)

Then name the file what ever u want, u can also either make it a .py file or .exe file.
You can also add a file picture if u would like (go to any browser and find a picture
you like then click on the png, jpeg)

Then When you finished that click the "Build" Button to create the Grabber,
when your done it should go to the folder where you opened the "README" Text file (this one).
